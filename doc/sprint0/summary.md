Objective: Create a game in which players take turns drawing a prompt card, and all the other players pick a response card to show to the first player, who judges it and picks the best/worst, awarding/deducting points to that player.
Personas: This project will focus on delivering for the personas Sarah and Margaret from [personas.pdf](./Personas.pdf), in order to deliver an easy to navigate UI for users who may not be the most tech savvy, and an easy to learn experience that can be played with friends and family.
Scenarios: The usage scenarios will involve 
            1. Creating a room for other players to join, or joining a room that has already been created
            2. Rotating prompt cards between different players, who will judge the responses given by the rest of the players. Adjust points of the other players accordingly.
            3. Once a winner is decided, end the game, and give the option to start a new one or for players to join/leave
Principles: The UI should be simple and intuitive, enabling people with all ranges of computer skills to be able to navigate it effectively, as well as delivering a multiplayer experience, so that the game can be shared and played with many people at the same time.
