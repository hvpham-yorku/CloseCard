This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
## CloseCard 
  CloseCard is an online party game where players are meant to show their personalities through their responses to random prompts. Players are able to get to know their friends and have a fun time letting loose and creating some creative responses to the prompts. CloseCard is designed to foster connection, creativity and community online!!
