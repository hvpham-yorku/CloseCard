This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Important Step
Before running the application, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory and add
your `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_SECRET` environment variables.

Get these keys from [Rayhaan](https://github.com/itzray116R) and then add them into your .env file to run

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
